# Empirical Performance Analysis of AutoML Techniques on Clean and Noisy Data

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) enables the automation of crucial machine learning (ML) steps such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. This project aims to evaluate the impact of clean data and noisy data on the performance of AutoML techniques.

- Following AutoML techniques are considered:
  - [TPOT](https://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/)
  - [AutoKeras](https://autokeras.com/)
- Following datasets are considered for text classification task:
  - [IRIS](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris)
  - [IMDB](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
